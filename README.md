# Interactive Command-Line Text File Processor

A C-based, interactive, menu-driven file analyzer that processes large text files and computes detailed statistics about their contents. <br>
Designed with a modular structure and flexible runtime options, the program supports configurable features such as punctuation filtering, number counting, and adjacent repeated letter detection. <br>
It demonstrates structured input handling, modular programming practices, and clean terminal-based CLI design for real-time file analysis.

## Project Structure
```
SecondProject.c      # command line interface + menu logic
ProcessFile.c        # file reading + character analysis
SecondProject.h      # constants and function signatures
Makefile             # to compile easier
MobyDick.txt         # sample larger input file to test
input.txt            # alternate smaller input file to test
```

## Features 

- Interactive command-line menu with 9 selectable runtime options
- Processes any `.txt` file (tested on 200,000+ word files like *Moby Dick*)
- Tracks:
  - Total word count
  - Number of words by length (1‚Äì20+ characters)
  - Number of words that start with each letter (A‚ÄìZ)
  - Total punctuation characters (`-p` flag)
  - Total digit characters (`-n` flag)
  - Adjacent repeated letter patterns (e.g. ‚Äúletter‚Äù ‚Üí `T`)
- Supports multi-file sessions: you can analyze another file WITHOUT restarting the program
- Modular design: separates logic into `SecondProject.c`, `ProcessFile.c`, and `SecondProject.h`
- Clean resets of counters (word, digit, punctuation) between runs

## How to Compile and Run
1. Compile using Makefile: `make`

OR manually:

`gcc -o processMake SecondProject.c ProcessFile.c`

2. Run: ```./processMake```

Then follow the command line prompts to:
- load a `.txt` file
- enable/disable flags
- display analysis results

## How It Works

The program is structured as an interactive, menu-driven loop that allows users to analyze large text files with flexible configurations. Here is how it works:

1. **User Input (Interactive Command Line Interface)**
   - Prompts the user to enter a valid filename.
   - Displays a runtime menu (Options 1‚Äì6) to:
     - Set flags to set flags: punctuation (`-p`) and number (`-n`) 
     - Change or reprocess files
     - Exit the program

2. **File Processing via `processFile() function`**
   - Reads characters one-by-one from the file using `fgetc()`.
   - Tracks the following:
     - Total word count
     - Word lengths (up to 20+ characters, into `wordLen[]`)
     - First letters of words (A‚ÄìZ), into `alphabetCount[]`
     - Number of repeated letters (`repeatedLetters[]`)
     - Punctuation (`-p` flag)
     - Digit frequency (`-n` flag)

3. **Runtime Reporting**
   - After processing, users can choose from 9 output options:
     - Query specific letter counts, word lengths, total digits, or punctuation
     - View repeated letters
     - Process a new file without restarting

## Design Notes

- **Modular File Structure**
  - `SecondProject.c` ‚Äì user interface, menu flow, control logic
  - `ProcessFile.c` ‚Äì handles file parsing and character-level analysis
  - `SecondProject.h` ‚Äì stores shared constants and function declarations

- **Fixed-Size Arrays for Simplicity**
  - Uses pre-defined arrays for word length, alphabet counts, repeated letters,...
  - Avoids dynamic memory allocation and handles EOF gracefully

- **Interactive Flexibility**
  - All flags (`-p`, `-n`) and filenames are managed during runtime
  - Users can switch files and view stats without restarting or recompiling

## About This Project

This was built as a **second iteration** of a previous word analysis program written in C. It introduces:
- A cleaner user experience by a command line interface menu
- Support for runtime toggling of features
- Expanded functionality (repeated letters, file swapping)
- Stronger error-checking and modularity

<br>

## üí° Ideas for Future Improvement

- Add histogram/graph to visualize word or letter distributions
- Export analysis results to `.csv` or `.json` files
- Refactor to use `structs` or dynamic memory for more extensibility
